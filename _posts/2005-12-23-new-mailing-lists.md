Because our development mailing list was filled up with support requests and configuration questions, we decided to add a separate list for RoundCube USERS and keep the dev-list for discussions about ongoing development. If you have questions about the installation, configuration and use of RoundCube Webmail, please subscribe and post to users@lists.roundcube.net

Also there's a complete archive with all posts to the dev-list available now: [lists.roundcube.net](https://lists.roundcube.net)
