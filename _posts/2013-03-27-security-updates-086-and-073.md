In order to find out whether one of your users has vulnerable preferences, you can run the following query on the Roundcube user database:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE preferences LIKE '%generic_message_footer%'

If this returns any results, you should block that user because he or she most likely tried to exploit your system.

And here's some background about the vulnerability from the [mailing list archive](https://lists.roundcube.net/hyperkitty/list/dev@lists.roundcube.net/thread/D4TYGDBJXMRXEEMTWE32A7NZDHINOTFL/).
