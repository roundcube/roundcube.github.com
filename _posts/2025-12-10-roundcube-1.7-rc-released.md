title: Roundcube 1.7 RC released
tags: releases beta
---

The development team is pleased to announce the release candidate for the next major version 1.7 of Roundcube webmail!

With this milestone we introduce a few breaking changes (see below) and some further improvements in comparison to 1.7-beta2.

Some noteworthy changes are:

- Add scope parameter to contact search (#9863)
- Add ability to chose from all available contact fields on CSV import (#9419)
- Add a new plugin called `markdown_editor` that provides an alternative editor to compose emails using Markdown syntax.
- Add rel='noopener' to all links opening in a new window to mitigate against misuse in older browsers.

#### Breaking Changes

- Remove `contact_search_name` option in favor of `contactlist_name_template` (#9832)
- Replace session attribute `changed` by `expires_at` (to allow for variable session lengths per-user in a future change).
- Password: Removed the (insecure) virtualmin driver (#8007)

For full details and download links please read the [release notes](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.7-rc).

We believe it is production ready, but we recommend to test it on a separate environment.

Migrate existing configs with either the installto.sh or the update.sh scripts.

And don't forget to backup your data before installing it!
