We just published the third release candidate for the next major version 1.7 of Roundcube webmail.

This release fixes two security issues, and contains a few more fixes for several issues.

The security fixes are:

- Fix CSS injection vulnerability reported by CERT Polska.
- Fix remote image blocking bypass via SVG content reported by nullcathedral.

For the full changelog please see [the release page](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.7-rc3).

The tarballs can be downloaded [via roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download/).

Or directly from [the release page at github.com](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.7-rc3).

We believe it is production ready, but we recommend to test it on a separate environment.

Migrate existing configs with either the `installto.sh` or the `update.sh` scripts.

And don't forget to backup your data before installing it!
