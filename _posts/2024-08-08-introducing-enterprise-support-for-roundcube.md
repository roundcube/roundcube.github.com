Today, we are excited to introduce the first official [offering of enterprise
support for Roundcube!](https://nextcloud.com/roundcube) It is tailored
specifically for mail providers running large instances with thousands to
millions of end users. We also offer our services to help businesses,
universities and the public sector, but our offering makes the most sense for
larger installations.

Our goal is to help organisations that want to deploy Roundcube â€“ lowering the
barrier to entry and helping Roundcube grow. And, of course, the improvements,
bug fixes and funds that come out of this will go back into Roundcube, making
it a better product for everybody!

The offering optionally includes mail server options Dovecot Pro or Stalwart,
as well as encrypted emails thanks to the privacy experts at Mailvelope.
