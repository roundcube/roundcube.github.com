These are immediate service releases to fix regressions introduced in the most recent security updates.
Both releases contain two following fixes:

- Fix regression where printing/scaling/rotating image attachments was broken (#9571)
- Fix regression where HTML messages were displayed unstyled (#9586)

These releases are considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations 
of Roundcube with these. Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).
