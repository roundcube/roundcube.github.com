title: Roundcube 1.7 RC2 released
tags: releases beta
---

We just published the second release candidate for the next major version 1.7 of Roundcube webmail.

This release fixes two security issues and one syntax error in a database migration file for Postgres databases.

The changes are:

- Fix Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability via SVG’s animate tag reported by Valentin T., CrowdStrike.
- Fix Information Disclosure vulnerability in the HTML style sanitizer reported by somerandomdev.
- Fix syntax error in DDL scripts for Postgres (#10052)

For the download links please see the [release page](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.7-rc2).

We believe it is production ready, but we recommend to test it on a separate environment.

Migrate existing configs with either the `installto.sh` or the `update.sh` scripts.

And don't forget to backup your data before installing it!
