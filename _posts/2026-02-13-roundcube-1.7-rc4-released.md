title: Roundcube 1.7 RC4 released
tags: releases beta
---

We just published the fourth release candidate for the next major version 1.7 of Roundcube webmail.

This release fixes two minor issues, it's mostly published to fix a file permission problem in the previous release v1.7-rc3.

The changes are:

- Ensure correct file permissions when building a release.
- Installer: Fix broken link to download the created configuration file (#10092)

The tarballs can be downloaded [from roundcube.net/download](https://roundcube.net/download/).

Or directly from [the release page at github.com](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.7-rc4).

We believe it is production ready, but we recommend to test it on a separate environment.

Migrate existing configs with either the `installto.sh` or the `update.sh` scripts.

And don't forget to backup your data before installing it!
