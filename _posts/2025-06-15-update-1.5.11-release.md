This is the next service release to update the LTS version 1.5 of Roundcube.
It only fixes a compatibility issue with PHP 5.5 that slipped into the previous (1.5.10) release.

This release is considered stable and if you wasn't able to upgrade to 1.5.10 yet
you should update now. Download it from [roundcube.net](https://roundcube.net/download).

Please do backup your data before updating!
