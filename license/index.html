<h1>Roundcube Licensing</h1>

<p>As of January 2012 Roundcube is licensed under the
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" class="rc-icon external-link" target="_blank">GNU General Public License</a>
    (GPL) Version 3 or later (with exceptions for skins & plugins) while it was
    licensed under GPL (v2) before that change.
    Actually the license situation wasn't absolutely clear before because some
    parts of the Roundcube code didn't specify a version number of the GPL
    while others did. Those parts not specifying a version number could,
    according to the GPL license text, be considered as either version 2
    or any later version.</p>

<h2 id="clarification">Clarification and Preparation for the Future <a class="anchor" href="#clarification" aria-label="Link to this section: Clarification and Preparation for the Future"></a></h2>

<p>Because of the incorporated numerous other components, the only options for
    licenses are in the GNU GPL family, namely GNU GPLv2, GNU GPLv3, GNU AGPLv3.</p>

<p>In order to become license compatible with some of the newer technologies we
    would like to be able to use and to be well prepared for future development
    and integration we decided to officially change to GNU GPL
    &quot;version 3 or any later version&quot;.</p>

<p>Together with the change to GPLv3+ we also added the following exception
    to the Roundcube license agreement which explicitly <b>excludes skins & plugins</b>
    from the terms of the GPL:</p>

<div class="bg-quote p-3 mb-3 font-monospace">
    <p>This file forms part of the Roundcube Webmail Software for which the
        following exception is added: Plug-ins and Skins which merely
        make function calls to the Roundcube Webmail Software, and for that
        purpose include it by reference shall not be considered
        modifications of the software.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">If you wish to use this file in another project or create a
        modified version that will not be part of the Roundcube Webmail Software,
        you may remove the exception above and use this source code under
        the original version of the license.</p>
</div>

<p>This shall give a maximum flexibility to skin designers
and plugin developers to choose any other license for their work or even to create
commercial or proprietary components without being forced to publish them according
to the strong copy-left requirements of the GPL.</p>

<p>The proposal and the following discussion about this license clarification can be read
    in our <a href="https://lists.roundcube.net/hyperkitty/list/dev@lists.roundcube.net/thread/EZTGUKDDQE2MG5L7WKRPWAYZYUOBGBCR/" class="rc-icon external-link" target="_blank">mailing list archive</a>.</p>

<h2 id="request">Request for Agreement <a class="anchor" href="#request" aria-label="Link to this section: Request for Agreement"></a></h2>

<p>Because the copyright in Roundcube is not consolidated, making these
updates requires the agreement of all contributors to Roundcube.</p>

<p>So if you have in the past contributed to Roundcube, we would very
much like to ask for your explicit agreement with this path
forward. We believe this primarily represents a clarification and an adjustment
to what we practiced over the past years.</p>

<p>But of course we cannot force anyone to agree, so for those who do not agree
    to this license update we still offer the choice to have their code removed
    from Roundcube.</p>

<p>Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> in case you have serious
    objections against the GPLv3+ with exceptions for skins &amp; plugins
    and you want your contributed code to be removed.</p>
