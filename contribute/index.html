<h1>How to Contribute</h1>

<p>Want to help make Roundcube the best webmail solution ever? Roundcube is an open source project and all volunteers are welcome, we're always looking for new additions and resources.</p>

<p>The Roundcube <a href="http://lists.roundcube.net/dev" class="rc-icon external-link" target="_blank">development mailing list</a> is the place where ongoing development is discussed.
This mailing list is not a support forum, and requests for help with non-development related problems will not be answered there.
Thanks for keeping the list on-topic and productive!</p>
